# Plan
A web 3D builder like Sketchup, but with more advantages in curve-surfaces.   
Weld base surface-objects to build a full mesh.  

Things todo:
- Architecture : Scene, View, Property-sheet, Elements, Operations...
- New Element, Place it, Move camera and set different view-modes(e.g. wire, unlit, solid, textured) to see it.
- Basic surfaces and surface split
- CSG operations
- Curve surfaces
- Export OBJ or FBX
